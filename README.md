# MightyScape for Inkscape 1.0+

# From now (15.02.2023) on this repository is deprecated and continued by https://github.com/eridur-de/mightyscape-1.2

In short: A maintained extension collection for Inkscape 1.0+, working on Windows and Linux. There are **238 extension folders** with **412 .inx files** inside. We also take part at https://inkscape.org/gallery/=extension/ (with single extension uploads).

# About MightyScape

Looking to get more productive we started using some more special Inkscape extensions. We love Inkscape. And we love things like 3d printing, laser cutting, vinyl cutting, pen plotting, maths, physics, geometry, patterns, 2D drawings, 3D CAD , embroidery and more stuff. All this you can do with Inkscape! We recognized that there is no good source to pull extensions in a quick and clean way. Each developer puts his own code on his hidden/unknown repository and often without enough documentation or visible results for common understanding. Many plugins are completely unknown that way, and a lot of extensions are forked x times or are unmaintained. So many of them do not work with recent Inkscape or were never tested with newer versions so far.

# What and why?

This is a one-to-bundle-them-all collection of hundreds of additional functions to Inkscape (extensions) for the new Python 3 based version 1.X including documentation, made  for makers and artists. All plugins where sorted into custom categories  (to avoid overloading the standard extension menu of Inkscape). You can find most of them in sub menu "FabLab Chemnitz". We renamed and cleaned a lot of *.inx files and *.py files. We applied some function renamings, id changes (for preferences.xml clean-keeping), spelling fixes, formattings and parameter corrections.

It took years to search and find all them on the web (so much different possible sources where to find!), to read, to comment (report issues), to fix problems, to test, to document and to provide them online. Many extensions were nearly lost in translation.

At least this repo will help to bring alife some good things and will show hidden gold. It meshes things together in a fresh and bundled way - with ease of use and minimum installation stress. A lot of code is not at the optimum. A mass of bugs has to be fixed and different tools should be improved in usage generally. This package will show errors more quickly. So hopefully a lot of new code fixes is result from this package. Maybe some people help to make all the stuff compatible with Inkscape 1.0 and newer.

# Used software for development

   * Gitea and Github for hosting this
   * LiClipse for code and git committing
   * regular Python installation (both Linux and Windows)

# Requirements / Tested environment

   * tested with Inkscape
       * Windows portable Version (Inkscape 1.2-dev (25cba68, 2021-05-16)) @ Windows 10
       * Linux dev trunk (https://inkscape.org/de/release/inkscape-master/gnulinux/ubuntu/ppa/dl/) @ Fedora 35
   * tested using Python 3.8.5 64 Bit and 3.9.4 64 Bit
   * some extensions require custom Python installation/modules. See documentation at our FabLab Chemnitz Wiki (see below).
   * some extensions require additional commands, packages or other installers (see documentation too).

# Alltime ToDos

  * clean code
  * make more precise documentation with more examples
  * check out command line handling of extension. This was totally ignored yet

# Installation, documentation and examples

The structure of this repo is intended the be easy. Just copy the complete MightyScape folder or the folders you want to your Inkscape's extension directory. You will find redundancies in this repo like node.exe (NodeJS). We did it this way to give easy possibilty to only pick the extensions you want (instead creating ~200 repositories). MightyScape does not work with any releases or feature branches. Just use "git clone" to get the recent commit from master branch. Please see at https://y.stadtfabrikanten.org/mightyscape-overview for installation tips like required python modules, file locations and other adjustments.
